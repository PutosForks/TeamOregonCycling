Hello <%= @user.display_name %>,

Someone (hopefully you) has requested a password reset for your account on the
Team Oregon website.

If this was you, please visit the following URL to log in and reset your
password:

<%= verify_reset_password_url(token: @user.password_reset_token) %>

Note that this link will expire after it is first used or in 24 hours from the
time this email was generated on our systems (whichever happens first).

If you did *not* request that your password be reset, don't worry; without
access to your email (and the above URL), your password will not be reset.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact us at
info@teamoregon.org. Do not reply to this message; it is sent from an account
that is not monitored for replies.

Regards,
Team Oregon
