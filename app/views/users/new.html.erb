      <p>Thank you for your interest in Team Oregon! We're looking forward to
        another excellent season of Road, Track, Mountain Bike and Cyclocross
        events.</p>

      <p>Team Oregon welcomes cyclists of <em>all</em> backgrounds and abilities.
        Whether you are an experienced racer or are thinking of pinning on a race
        number for the first time this season, we would love to support your goals
        as a member of our team.</p>

      <p>Benefits of team membership include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Discounted products or services from many of our sponsors</li>
        <li>Discounts on certain race entry fees (these can easily add up to more
          than what your membership costs over the course of a single season.)</li>
        <li>Awesome teammates who show up to race (we won the OBRA Team BAR
          competition in
          <a href="http://obra.org/bar/2015/team/team_bar">2015</a>,
