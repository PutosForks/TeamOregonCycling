          <p><strong>Thank you for your interest in Team Oregon!</strong></p>

          <p>We're looking forward to another excellent season of Road, Track,
            Mountain Bike and Cyclocross events.</p>

          <p>Team Oregon welcomes cyclists of <em>all</em> backgrounds and
            abilities. Whether you are an experienced racer or are thinking of
            pinning on a race number for the first time this season, we would
            love to support your goals as a member of our team.</p>

          <p>Benefits of team membership include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Discounted products or services from many of our sponsors</li>
            <li>Discounts on certain race entry fees (these can easily add up to
              more than what your membership costs over the course of a single
              season.)</li>
            <li>Awesome teammates who show up to race (we won the OBRA Team BAR
              competition in
              <a href="http://obra.org/bar/2015/team/team_bar">2015</a>,
